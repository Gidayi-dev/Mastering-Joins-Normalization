# JOIN
A ```Join``` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
Here are the main types of Joins:
* ```INNER JOIN```: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
* ```LEFT JOIN```: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
* ```RIGHT JOIN```: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
* ```FULL JOIN```: Returns when there is a match in either left or right table.

## INNER JOIN
The ```INNER JOIN``` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
